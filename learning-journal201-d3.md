# learning-journal Day three

Day three:  
first part of the day we spent time on creating, switching and working in git branches. I feel very comfortable with git.
After that we worked on javaScript data types, loops are still a bit harder for me to get, but I think I am getting them. The same goes for the booleans.
The box model for the css formatting is pretty easy to comprehend.
