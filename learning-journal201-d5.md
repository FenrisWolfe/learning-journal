Images, Color, Text!!  Fun..

Functions, Not so much, I need to grasp the concept. ASAP.

Not much to adding images, text and color to ones webpages, had a lot of fun with this in the Code Fellows 101 class..

Now FUNCTIONS, that's a horse of a different color.  I will be reading a LOT more on these and hope to find a resource that explains it to me like a 3rd grader! LOL!!(hmm, maybe Kindergarten would be more my speed)...
