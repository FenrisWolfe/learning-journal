# learning-journal Day two

Day two:  tensions are getting higher, the alphas are considering eating one or two of the betas.  I'm not sure where I stand on this, I'm on a diet. :O|


On the PLUS side, learning GIT, the CLI and code is fun.

Using the command line to do work keeps getting easier and EASIER for me as it is re-awakening my old Amiga and Dos command line usage.  (Windows 1 and 3.1, BAH!)

  Git allows one to keep track of changes in ones work.
Today we are learning git and the repository associated to it online. This way we can keep track of what we are coding and have backups to fall back on in case we need to keep old changes but add them to a new version of what we created, or we can fall back on that older commit.  Handy if you totally mess something up or if you think an earlier version is good enough/works better.

Coding the About me page makes me apprehensive, while yes, I have no problem speaking up in class, I am probably my own worse critic.  I suck at trying to define who I am as I have been struggling with this question a LONG time.

That being said, I look forward to the challenge in the coding aspect of it.
