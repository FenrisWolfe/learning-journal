Day two:  tensions are getting higher, the alphas are considering eating one or two of the betas.  I'm not sure where I stand on this.

On the PLUS side, learning GIT is fun.  Using the command line to do work is so much easier for me because it's harder and harder for me each day to use the mouse or trackpad to manipulate the environment on my laptop.

Git allows one to keep track of changes in ones work. Handy if you totally mess something up or if you think an earlier version is good enough/works better.
